# Nu-grounded methodology: sources and search record

Companion to the [methodological clarification](nu-grounded-maintenance-methodology-2026-09-14.md).
Date: **2026-09-14 HKT**. ISE source:
`7800549dd3ed598a4a7cfda235406ed2114f9537`.

This is bounded methodology/example research, not a systematic review, a
certificate of architecture quality or adoption of a new experiment. Search
hits are title/partial-abstract/excerpt screening unless body reading is stated.
The main agent owns methods and acceptance. A read-only Luna Max worker extracts
local Nu/public-code evidence; that is AI extraction, not human expert review.

## Primary method sources and reading extent

| Source | Verified identity / reading | Use and limitation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runeson and Höst, case-study guidelines | [10.1007/s10664-008-9102-8](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-008-9102-8), online 2008, journal issue 2009. Main read publisher §§2.1–2.5 and §§3.1–3.3 selected text. Scite served the abstract only; Lund PDF retrieval failed, then publisher HTML supplied methods. | Intentional cases, unit definitions, evidence triangulation and method distinctions. The recommendation applies these principles; no blanket claim that case studies cannot contain quantitative analyses is adopted. |
| Baltes and Ralph, sampling guidance | [10.1007/s10664-021-10072-8](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-021-10072-8), 2022; related [10.48550/arXiv.2002.07764](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2002.07764), [v6, 20 October 2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2002.07764v6). Main read introduction, §§2.1.1–2.1.3 and §6.2; publisher metadata/abstract checked. | Purposive selection versus claims of representativeness. Same study, not independent journal/preprint evidence. **Reject Scite's misassociated journal abstract**, which discussed teaching literature reviews; its fallback body repeated the wrong abstract. Primary sources supplied the relevant text. |
| Bengtsson et al., ALMA | [10.1016/S0164-1212(03)00080-3](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0164-1212(03)00080-3), 2004. Main read author-hosted PDF §§4.1–4.6 selected methods and §8; Scite provided no readable body. | Scenario elicitation, prediction versus stress/comparison goals, impact-analysis limits. Does not itself measure agent maintenance or establish a causal F# advantage. |
| Barr et al., test-oracle survey | [10.1109/TSE.2014.2372785](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2014.2372785), IEEE TSE 2015. Scite partial abstract, author/institutional abstract and indexed PDF front matter read; no full-survey assessment. | Running tests versus determining correct behavior. Its relevance to outside-LLM evaluators is explicitly our inference, not a contemporary LLM result. |

## Published F# system examples

| Work | Primary source / extent | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Steinlechner, Haaser, Maierhofer and Tobler, *Attribute Grammars for Incremental Scene Graph Rendering* | [10.5220/0007372800770088](https://doi.org/10.5220/0007372800770088), GRAPP/VISIGRAPP 2019, pp. 77–88. Publisher indexed full-paper/landing confirms identity; main read author preprint abstract and §3, especially §§3.1–3.2. | Real mixed F#/C# declarative/incremental graphics architecture, not a controlled maintainability comparison. A second Scite DOI, `10.5220/0007372800002108`, has the same title/authors but unresolved edition relation; not counted as another study or used as the canonical citation. |
| Dzik et al., *MBrace: Cloud Computing with Monads* | [10.1145/2525528.2525531](https://doi.org/10.1145/2525528.2525531), PLOS 2013. Scite exact DOI returned title *MBrace*; indexed project PDF supplies subtitle/authors/front matter and abstract/introduction. Direct PDF and ACM body opens failed. | Example of an implemented F# model/runtime, not reviewed performance or maintainability evidence. No claim about current production support. |

Other retrieved F# leads, including VoxLogicA, F# history, WebSharper/distributed
applications and an SSRN F# game-engine paper, remain unassessed for the specific
architectural-maintenance claim. An SSRN/arXiv identifier alone does not establish
peer review. The F# publications site and project pages supplied discovery leads,
not independent controlled evidence.

## Search limits

No dates, citation thresholds or publication-type filters were used in the Scite
searches below. Requests were relevance ordered, offset zero. Broad `F#`,
`FSharp` and `Aardvark` queries returned many unrelated architecture, imaging,
music and animal records; exact-title/DOI lookup and primary methods were needed.
These noisy results are not evidence that relevant F# work is absent. No search
is claimed to have reached saturation.

The exact phrase `"Nu game engine"` returned zero Scite records. That bounds only
this query/index; it is not a claim that Nu has never appeared in a paper.

## DOI decision inventory

The initial M1–M8 queries' 79 returned positions contain **74 distinct DOI identifiers**.
Seven identifiers are credited, representing six works after the sampling
journal/preprint pair is collapsed. The other 67 are not credited;
unread relevant leads are not thereby judged low quality. Only selected body
sections of four identifiers were read, as recorded above. Search excerpts
and paper bibliographies are not full-paper reading or additional screened
studies. DOI case is normalized, not a new identity.

## Primary recheck of the candidate gap

Following the user's permission to revise the analysis for research value, the
main agent revisited the primary editions of
[CodeThread v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2606.21804v1),
[Needle in the Repo v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2603.27745v1), and
[SlopCodeBench v2](https://arxiv.org/html/2603.24755v2).
Their DOI identities are [10.48550/arXiv.2606.21804](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2606.21804),
[10.48550/arXiv.2603.27745](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2603.27745), and
[10.48550/arXiv.2603.24755](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2603.24755).
Reading here covered CodeThread's introduction and §§3.1–3.3; Needle's
starter-shaping and dual-oracle methods (§§3.2–3.3) and motivating example;
and SlopCodeBench's inherited-workspace/fresh-conversation method passages.
These are selected sections, not new complete-paper reviews.

CodeThread changes prior authorship; Needle tests compliance with supplied
architectural boundaries; SlopCodeBench tracks agents' evolving implementations.
The proposed extension is to compare plausible, specified architectural
alternatives by subsequent behavioral outcomes. This distinction supports
investigating the gap; it is not an exhaustive absence claim. The
[prior frontier ledger](research-frontier-gap-sources-2026-09-14.md) retains
the broader search, versions and related work. These three identifiers are
additional credited web-primary rechecks, outside the 74 Scite identifiers above.

## Nu source extraction and limits

The user-requested neighboring analysis supplied discovery and a pinned public
Nu checkout. Its private conversations were not used as public empirical data,
quoted, published or modified. Public source identity is
`bryanedds/Nu@064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d`.
One read-only Luna Max worker extracted source leads; the main agent checked
the root README, two empty templates, the stub-world test and commit identity,
and owns the interpretation. This is AI source extraction and self-review,
not human expert validation.

| Public source at that pin | Evidence and boundary |
| --- | --- |
| [Root README](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/ReadMe.md#L5) | Advertises MMCC and ImSim and names both Breakout tutorials. Architectural-quality/promotional claims are not adopted as empirical results. A worker's initially wrong nested README path was caught and corrected before publication. |
| [MMCC empty template](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Nu/Nu.Template.Mmcc.Empty/MyGame.fs#L7) and [ImSim empty template](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Nu/Nu.Template.ImSim.Empty/MyGame.fs#L7) | First-class application styles in one language/engine. The templates differ in behavior/details; no matched maintenance pair is established. |
| [World types](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Nu/Nu/World/WorldTypes.fs#L1939) | Snapshot-oriented state with a mutable wrapper, not purity enforced throughout the engine. |
| [World update branch](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Nu/Nu/World/WorldModule.fs#L297) and [Gaia undo/redo](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Nu/Nu.Gaia/Gaia.fs#L505) | Imperative versus copying paths and snapshot use are concrete design leads. No maintenance benefit was measured. |
| [Event graph](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Nu/Nu/EventGraph/EventGraph.fs#L49) | Event-state organization is inspectable; not a claim that this is event sourcing or a globally pure engine. |
| [Stub-world test](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Nu/Nu.Tests/WorldTests.fs#L15) | Static source calls initialization, a stub world and a one-frame run. This investigation performed no build/run and did not establish a working headless candidate sandbox. |

Curated material in this 2026-09-14 pass did not yield a verified Nu-specific public issue/PR task.
The examples in the methodology note are illustrations, not mined instances. The later [2026-10-11 audit](nu-source-contracts-and-scenarios-2026-10-11.md) verifies #1145's issue-to-patch lineage and refines ownership/history contracts at the same pin; that historical workaround is already present, so it does not itself supply an eligible new matched task.
The extracted [F# compiler PR 772](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/772)
and [Lerna issue 1636](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/1636) concern
governance and are excluded as engine-maintenance task evidence. The historical
[Xi lineage](https://github.com/bryanedds/Xi/tree/4de3fd3ad9b9f39a39343d60566fcb13cddec728)
is not an independently authored comparator. No unavailable/private historical
engine is nominated as a public control.


## Follow-up: lineage and research-gap fit

The user clarified that MMCC adapts MVU and ImSim adapts ImGui, and that the
Breakout samples are intended to behave alike. This is retained as user-supplied
design history and intended behavior, not an independently tested result.
The main agent added a concrete, unadopted architecture-by-change-family
hypothesis rather than treating documented ancestry as the contribution.

Two initial Scite requests failed connector validation because `user_intent`
exceeded its configured 100-character maximum. They returned **no search
results**, not zero matches. Both were corrected and succeeded; the successful
queries below have no date/type/citation filters, offset zero.

| ID | Exact selection | Returned / reported total |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M9 | `("model-view-update" OR "immediate mode GUI" OR "immediate-mode GUI")`; limit 15 | 15 / 41 |
| M10 | Exact DOIs `10.4230/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2020.14` and `10.48550/arXiv.1910.11108`; limit 5 | 2 / 2 |

These 17 positions add 15 distinct Scite DOI identifiers to M1–M8:
**96 positions / 89 distinct Scite identifiers** overall. One additional DOI
is credited, 14 excluded; the related preprint/artifact are not separate studies.
At initial screening the whole Scite set credited eight identifiers representing
seven works, after collapsing the sampling journal/preprint pair. The later
user-triggered metadata correction below changes one exclusion to a citation;
do not mistake missing fields for a negative relevance judgment.

See correction below; initial exclusion was access-only. |

Fowler's [publisher abstract/metadata](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2020.14)
and [institutional record](https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/223081/) were inspected.
The latter explicitly records refereed status. No full proof or empirical
maintenance evaluation was read or claimed. The related preprint is
`10.48550/arXiv.1910.11108`; the related artifact is
`10.4230/DARTS.6.2.13`. Neither is credited as independent evidence.

The main read the [official Elm architecture overview](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/)
and Dear ImGui's [primary maintainer explanation](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/About-the-IMGUI-paradigm),
especially its API/state definition and warning about umbrella terms.
These are practitioner documentation, not peer-reviewed maintenance results.
The Nu README directly attributes ImSim to ImGui; the MMCC-to-MVU historical
attribution here remains the user's statement, supported in form by the code
but not independently established as a historical claim.

A read-only worker inspected the two pinned Breakout trees. Both implement the
same named screens and game genre. The user confirms intended parity. However,
[ImSim gameplay](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Projects/Breakout%20ImSim/Gameplay.fs#L75)
uses physics-body/collision results, while
[MMCC gameplay](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Projects/Breakout%20Mmcc/Gameplay.fs#L85)
updates model coordinates and performs explicit intersection tests.
That difference matters to selecting comparable contracts; it is not proof
that the games fail their intended purpose. UI/control wiring in
[ImSim](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Projects/Breakout%20ImSim/Breakout.fs#L24)
and [MMCC](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Projects/Breakout%20Mmcc/Breakout.fs#L16)
is another possible contrast. No build, gameplay observation, equivalence test,
new task or adapter was performed.

Web follow-up searches were `"Model-View-Update" Fowler ECOOP`,
`"immediate mode" "graphical user interfaces" paper architecture` and
`site:github.com/bryanedds/Nu MMCC MVU`. They provided lineage and related leads,
not a comprehensive novelty search. An accidental placeholder URL open was
rejected and supplied no evidence; the subsequent actual DOI open for
`10.18420/vrar2022_1678` also failed. No absence/quality inference follows.

## Supplementary web access and discovery inventory

Web access was used to obtain primary methods, resolve F# example identities
and recheck the closest prior interventions. It was not a second systematic
database search. The table preserves 72 distinct URLs from the retained web
initial discovery/access responses (W1–W72), followed by 28 lineage-query
and primary-document URLs (W73–W100). Alternate copies of credited papers map to their
DOI decisions above; they are not additional studies. Other entries are
title/snippet-level leads not used for effect claims. An excerpt from another
paper's bibliography is not body reading of either paper.

Access failures retained: Lund's linked guideline PDF and an initial DOI
redirect failed before the canonical publisher HTML succeeded; Scite supplied
no ALMA body; MBrace's direct project PDF/ACM body opens failed; the scene-graph
publisher landing later returned 502 after indexed primary metadata was
available. Sampling's misassociated Scite abstract was rejected. Do not infer
a paper's quality from access failure.

## User-triggered metadata correction

After the first citation audit closed, the user supplied the missing title for
`10.1117/12.3020480`. An exact Scite lookup (M11, `dois` containing only
that DOI, limit 1) again returned one record with no title, an empty abstract
and `contentDenied=true`. Therefore the metadata problem persisted through
two queries; whether it is temporary or an indexing/connector defect is
undetermined. It is not an evidence-based exclusion for relevance or quality.
M11 raises the search-position total to **97**, leaving **89** distinct Scite
DOIs. The corrected Scite decisions are nine credited / 80 excluded.

The [Crossref DOI record](https://api.crossref.org/works/10.1117%2F12.3020480)
verifies *Real-time adaptive optics control with a high level programming
language*, SPIE, *Adaptive Optics Systems IX*, published 3 September 2024.
The user correction is accepted after that independent identity check.
Direct DOI/publisher opening failed. Main read the
[primary preprint v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07207v1),
[10.48550/arXiv.2407.07207](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2407.07207),
especially the introduction and §§2.4–2.5. This is a related edition, not a
second independent system study or a full-paper review.

The Julia system combines hierarchical state machines, event messages and
Dear ImGui. This is a concrete counterexample to a false binary between
explicit-state architecture and immediate-mode interfaces. It does not measure
agent maintenance or establish a superiority claim. The methodology note was
refined accordingly: compare source-level responsibility placement, not
umbrella categories. The original access-only exclusion and its reason remain
identifiable in the first audit; the corrected row and audit supersede it.

The related [ALMA experience paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0164-1212(01)00113-3)
was also considered at publisher abstract/intro level earlier and not credited
beyond the selected 2004 ALMA methods anchor. It is separately recorded in the
audit, outside the Scite-retrieved DOI set.

The correction's additional retrieval paths are below. Primary-paper/registry
URLs map to their credited DOI; secondary listings and bibliography-only hits
are not additional evidence.

## Closed source-decision audits and checks

Initial answer ID `alf-nu-grounded-methodology-2026-09-14` recorded
**15 credited / 183 excluded / 0 skipped**, with 198 screened source identities.
This snapshot predates the user's adaptive-optics metadata correction.

The complete corrected answer ID
`alf-nu-grounded-methodology-corrected-2026-09-14` supersedes those decisions:
**17 credited / 201 excluded / 0 skipped**, with 218 screened source identities.
Its answer-scoped verification is untruncated, has no missing reasons and
`retrieval_unlinked=false`. The tool's retrieved total is null for an
answer-scoped report, not zero and not proof of search completeness.

The corrected set contains 89 Scite DOI identities, 123 web-source identities,
five `other` identities (pinned public code, three source-discovery leads and
Crossref), and one attributed user clarification. The 17 credited identities
include 13 publication/preprint DOIs representing 11 works after the sampling
and adaptive-optics edition pairs are collapsed, two primary practitioner
documents, one pinned codebase and one user-intent attribution. These are not
17 independent empirical studies. Eleven decisions use the tool's
`full_text` stage for selected paper/code/document reading, not eleven
completely read papers. Do not add the two audit totals together.

Main-agent self-review checked claim boundaries, primary versus practitioner
evidence, treatment versus author/engine confounding, intended versus tested
parity, architectural compatibility and the future-gold/live hold. The worker's
read-only source extraction is separate AI evidence, not human review. Local
validation passed 11 CI-routing regressions and strict UTF-8/local-link checks;
final whitespace validation and CI are tied to the exact publication. No engine
build, fixture reconstruction, candidate execution, model/count call, OAuth
staging or scientific treatment was run or changed.

## Later coverage update — 2026-10-03

The earlier Aardvark partial reading is now upgraded by [S238’s complete publisher reading and three historical source files](literature/full-reading/S238-attribute-grammar-rendering.md). The publisher canonical DOI, two synthetic cost comparisons and actual Assimp integration are reconstructed. The alternate DOI has matching title/authors/pages; the author-page journal draft is unavailable and its definitive-version link points to an unrelated chapter. The dated M1–M8 coverage and decisions above remain historical; this is not another independent study or a new controlled maintenance result.
