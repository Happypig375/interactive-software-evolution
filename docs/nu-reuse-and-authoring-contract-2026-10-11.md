# Nu reuse: authoring a variant versus extending its vocabulary

**Decision, 2026-10-11:** R12's first candidate reuse unit is a persistent, explicitly named entity tree authored in Gaia with existing dispatchers/facets and a declared propagation source. This is an existing source-supported facility, not a proposed new editor. Separate configuring an instance, propagating a family revision and adding behavior outside the prepared vocabulary. The case supports R01/R05/R06 and a future R20 role study; no reuse benefit, designer independence or execution is established. [PLAN](../PLAN.md) retains all construction and experimental holds.

## Existing mechanism and its boundary

All Nu references use **`064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d`**. The [README](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/ReadMe.md#L93) advertises recursive prefab-like entity-structure propagation. This is a maintainer capability claim, not a comparative result; its linked image was not inspected. Selected implementation and editor paths supply the following narrower account.

| Source mechanism | Consequence for the proposed reuse unit |
| --- | --- |
| [Overlays](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Nu/Nu/Overlayer/Overlayer.fs#L38) derive intrinsic property defaults from dispatcher/facet definitions, with inheritance and optional external property sets. Variable/computed expressions are not converted into those intrinsic default symbols. | An empty external overlay file does not mean that no overlay/default machinery exists. The inspected Gaia, Sand Box 2d, Terra Firma and both Breakout external files are empty; they do not supply an existing nonempty configuration family for this case. This is a bounded sample, not a repository-wide absence claim. |
| [Overlay classification](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Nu/Nu/Overlayer/Overlayer.fs#L120) compares a current property value with its converted default. Matching values are classified Overlaid; altered/bare values may serialize, while overlaid/nonpersistent ones do not. | The inspected mechanism records values/default correspondence, not a separate author's intent to pin an equal-valued override. A request to retain a value even when it equals the old default needs an explicit supported representation or extra work. No observed data loss is claimed. |
| [Descriptor writing](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Nu/Nu/World/WorldModuleEntity.fs#L2423) uses that serialization policy, with separate order/history options. Child traversal includes persistent entities except DeclarativeProtection. | Use unprotected, persistent editor-authored trees with unique explicit sibling names for the first case. Code-declared MMCC/ImSim content is not automatically the same authoring unit. A saved descriptor is not a snapshot of every reachable runtime value. |
| [Property propagation](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Nu/Nu/World/WorldModule2.fs#L548) compares previous source, current source and target descriptors. A target symbol matching the previous source follows the current source; a differing target can remain. Missing symbols use additional overlay/default branches. | A useful family-change mechanism exists. Its value comparison is not a guarantee of semantic conflict resolution or preserved user intent. Before claiming an override survives, identify which serialized/default branch actually represents it. |
| The property loop explicitly excludes Name, Position, Rotation, Elevation, PropagationSourceOpt and PropagatedDescriptorOpt. [Children](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Nu/Nu/World/WorldModule2.fs#L656) are matched by name. A source-deleted prior child is dropped even if a target version exists; a target-only child is retained. For a previously known nonempty-dispatcher child still in the source but absent in the target, recursion starts with an [empty descriptor](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Nu/Nu/World/WorldTypes.fs#L1813), retains its different empty dispatcher and the final filter omits it. | Local deletion can survive this ordinary revision; source presence alone does not imply resurrection. A later source deletion and reintroduction instead takes a new-child path. Renaming changes name-based matching, not an inspected stable-identity mapping. Position/rotation exclusions are not a theorem about all local/world transforms. These are source-derived policies, not exercised outcomes. |
| [Applying propagation](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Nu/Nu/World/WorldModule2.fs#L722) serializes targets, destroys/recreates each existing eligible target, updates the source's saved descriptor and can recurse through sourced ancestors. [Destruction](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Nu/Nu/World/WorldModuleEntity.fs#L2235) unregisters, removes entity-owned tasklets and recursively destroys children. | Reusing the same address does not preserve runtime lifetime, pending work or arbitrary external effects. Select quiescent authoring for the first case; live gameplay propagation would need its own continuation/effect contract. Include rebuilding and affected ancestors in costs. |
| Gaia's [duplicate path](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Nu/Nu.Gaia/Gaia.fs#L1613) can establish or remove a propagation source. [Push/Wipe](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Nu/Nu.Gaia/Gaia.fs#L1991) and the [Propagation Sources panel](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/blob/064f7ae92a8506689cd91aff5e6804a375d6ef3d/Nu/Nu.Gaia/Gaia.fs#L2966) expose actual controls; the propagation wrapper snapshots first. | The inspected facility has an editor route. Its existence does not establish agent transport, trained-user success or reliable undo of all effects. Wiping targets/history changes the future update policy and is not cost-free preservation. |

This propagation mechanism is distinct from R03's same-code history, R10's model conversion and an R11 multi-person merge facility. It has a saved source descriptor and reconciliation rules; that alone does not establish version control, concurrent-edit conflict reporting or a CRDT. No new guarantee of those kinds is attributed to Nu.

## Proposed authoring and change contract

Use a prepared family of ordinary GUI button assemblies as the first reviewable candidate: a root with the existing button behavior and explicitly named persistent decorative children. The [existing input audit](nu-pause-exit-contract-2026-10-11.md) binds the normal button click path; this family is newly authored, not a mined feature request or an observed project template. Pin the allowed properties, assets, component types and behavior before assignment. Verify that the chosen editor-created assembly and ordinary click route are supported; no assembly has been constructed here.

1. **Create a supported variant.** Change the label, selected exposed properties and declared placement using the supplied vocabulary. Preserve enabled/disabled click behavior and unrelated instances. Correct rendering alone is insufficient: the chosen ordinary interaction must still occur under its declared input policy. Give every workflow equivalent assets, requirements and ordinary documentation.
2. **Revise a family.** Change a shared property and add or remove a named decorative child across linked instances while preserving nominated instance-specific differences. Declare source-authoritative deletion and target-only additions when those are intended. Exercise local deletion under ordinary source revision separately from source deletion/reintroduction. If an equal-valued pinned override or rename preserving a child's logical identity is required, state it explicitly rather than assuming propagation records that intent. Do not hide a difficult instance by deleting it from the outcome set.
3. **Extend the vocabulary.** A later hold-to-confirm control with cancellation on early release changes the ordinary click contract; label this an authored extension of the prepared button family, not another label/configuration choice. First check whether the frozen set of available components already expresses it. If so, it is configuration; otherwise count the necessary component/code, authoring-interface, documentation, integration and verification changes. No claim that all of Nu lacks such a facility follows from inspecting one button path.

These are separate task classes, not three mandatory arms or a sample-size justification. Keep task provenance and all assigned outcomes visible. A mechanism comparison may use bounded agents only under later authority; its outcomes cannot estimate designer productivity. For R20, a possible division is a programmer preparing the family and another role configuring it, with explicit escalation for unsupported behavior. That division is proposed, not observed human work or a verified non-specialist workflow.

The first propagation comparison concerns a quiescent editor-authored artifact, not preservation of an in-flight game. Before a family revision, record the prior source descriptor and eligible targets; initial duplication and the first propagation belong in setup work. With no prior descriptor the source path uses an empty one, so bootstrap and later revision are different conditions. Observe the resulting declared values, structure, nominated instance differences and working interaction after reconstruction; saving/reopening must preserve the declared family/instance policy if that is part of the task. Record whether propagation history is actually saved and restored. A correct alternative may recreate entities; do not score runtime object identity as preserved unless the requirement promises it. Missing input or property observations remain inconclusive rather than successes.

## Credible alternatives, evidence and total work

A credible ordinary comparator may use Nu's existing entity composition, duplication, named reusable F# helpers and parameter data as appropriate; it is not restricted to manually editing every copy. The exact supported implementation remains a later preparation/construction decision. A cross-engine claim would additionally require the other engine's ordinary prefab/inheritance facilities and matched semantics. This audit does not establish an engine ranking or novel reuse mechanism.

Completed [S255](literature/full-reading/S255-game-product-lines-comparison-partial.md) and [S256](literature/full-reading/S256-game-product-line-predecessor.md) supply favorable prepared product-line results and inconclusive MDD efficiency differences, with shared study lineage. Supported feature selections, handwritten code/models and their rubrics do not measure the cost of extending the generator or integrated runtime correctness. [S257](literature/full-reading/S257-unreal-model-code-comparison.md) adds favorable correctness on prepared Unreal tasks, no significant selected efficiency contrast and practitioner support for mixed code/visual workflows. Its scaffolding, integration and role assistance are part of the comparison; it supplies no pure syntax effect or measured Nu advantage. These completed reconstructions are reused, not new paper readings.

### 2026-10-15 practice and generation continuation

[S253's complete seven-organization study](literature/full-reading/S253-tools-expectations-reading-2026-10-15.md) reports generally acceptable existing infrastructure alongside bugs, occasional lost work, unstable or restrictive editors, usability, extensions and migration concerns. Across 27 role-structured sessions, the cases emphasize compatibility, platform and asset integration, rapid prototyping and change during production. Five organizations used third-party engines, often with local modification, while mature tools and bought assets were ordinary alternatives. These are purposively selected interview accounts without observed task outcomes or saved-work estimates. R12 must therefore credit an ordinary package of engine/editor reuse, duplication, composition, scripts/helpers and asset workflows rather than treating local mechanism construction or a manual-every-copy baseline as free.

[S254's complete final-edition reading](literature/full-reading/S254-game-reuse-reading-2026-10-15.md) supplies two studios, five projects and four developers from the same work lineage as the earlier preprint and replication package. It identifies prefabs as configured trees containing properties, components, children, scripts and assets, and reports a bespoke level editor that let a designer author content with fewer mistakes. It also reports upfront construction and expertise costs, redundancy, propagated errors, technical debt, misunderstood relations and dead prefabs. Cross-project reuse was estimated at only 2–5 percent with no resolved denominator. The favorable and adverse accounts strengthen the configuration/family-revision/vocabulary-extension split and require credible prefab, scene, Blueprint and helper/composition comparators, but they do not measure task completion, savings, break-even reuse or Nu's ability to preserve intent.

[S263/S264's completed paired reading](literature/full-reading/S263-S264-phylogenetic-generation-reading-2026-10-15.md) now closes the main-text and visual gap for a different comparison: hybrid content generation from the same 48-member Kromaia family. S263's LCG arm is favorable against its two evolutionary PCG baselines, but it bundles phylogenetic guidance with expert domain rules, manual ancestor reconstruction and integration. Selecting phylogenetically related seeds alone has a near-null Overall advantage over random seeds (Cliff's delta -0.04898). S264 reuses the same source family and S263 rows rather than independently replicating them; its new FICG arm has a statistically different but negligible Overall effect against LCG (Cliff's delta -0.021912), with the large gain confined to one metric. There is no pure expert-authoring baseline or productivity outcome. If a selected comparison uses generation, count encoding, rules, tree machinery, expert selection, manual reconstruction/injection, integration, repair and the actual reuse count. These results do not transfer to Nu's source propagation, instance-value retention or authoring benefit.

Separate total work into initial family/tool construction, onboarding/support, each supported variant, family revisions, vocabulary extensions, integration/verification and repair. Report the full assigned workload and the reuse count at which costs are incurred; do not presume a break-even point or amortize setup over hypothetical future variants. Count saved-source/history storage, serialization/default resolution, target destruction/recreation, ancestor propagation and observation overhead where relevant. An inexpensive configuration task can coexist with expensive extension or integration.

R12 now has a concrete reuse unit and a configuration/revision/extension boundary. Promote it only if an actual authoring or maintenance decision makes those trade-offs consequential. Before execution, establish the ordinary comparator, exact property/identity policy, supported editor/input access, saved-history behavior, valid alternative outcomes and total-work accounting. At the 2026-10-11 checkpoint, S263/S264's generation methods were access-limited; the 2026-10-15 continuation now supplies their bounded comparator evidence. They become relevant only if a selected comparison uses generation and do not block this distinct scene-family question. No editor operation, runtime, source variant, observer, human study, worker or model run was performed.

### 2026-10-15 alternative-authoring continuation

The complete [SuBViS](literature/full-reading/S274-subvis-access.md),
[BPAlt](literature/full-reading/S275-bpalt-partial-method.md) and
[NCAlt](literature/full-reading/S282-ncalt-access.md) readings close the selected
graph/class-alternative method gaps. They supply three different reuse units:
node/graph states, whole Blueprint classes with placed-actor choices, and
copied behavior-tree graphs with selected-node transfer. BPAlt replaces the
placed actor before play; its level scenario records class choices, not
arbitrary running state. NCAlt can paste disconnected nodes when a needed
parent is absent. These are useful supported policies, not evidence of Nu's
family-revision or live-continuation semantics.

The studies retain favorable subjective evidence with material bounds:
SuBViS has four assisted students and a recompile defect; BPAlt has ten paid
students, prepared templates and substantial tutorials; NCAlt has sixteen
paid students and a strong order interaction in its usability score.
BPAlt's selective merge/scenarios and later all-instance Play option were
outside its study, while NCAlt's efficiency/ease and selective-merge ratings
did not establish an advantage. No study measures complete construction,
extension, repair and verification work. Shared authorship is a lineage,
not independent replication or proof of person-level overlap.

For the prepared button-family comparison, allow ordinary duplication,
parameterized helpers, class/graph alternatives and explicit reconstruction
where applicable. Score the nominated values, structure and interaction after
reconstruction; do not add runtime-identity retention as an unstated
requirement. Charge setup, supplied solutions, assistance, missing-vocabulary
implementation, repair and verification to the proper role. Selective-copy
success and favorable ratings remain distinct from R20 productivity and R21
steering effectiveness, which are still unmeasured.

### 2026-10-15 Phylogenix final-edition continuation

The full [S262 original](literature/full-reading/S262-phylogenix-integration-partial.md)
now establishes its three figure and final-edition contents. It demonstrates
project-wide prefab relationship analysis and displays a Canvas cluster,
with four reported analysis times. This supports a diagnostic/organization
alternative when a task requires finding related objects. It does not test
source propagation, retained instance values, vocabulary extension, runtime
lifetime or authoring savings. Its four games overlap S254, while its exact
reported build and the paper/package method correspondence remain unresolved.

For a selected family revision, allow ordinary structural inspection alongside
prefabs, duplication and helpers. Observe the actual edit, child/target identity,
retained variation, behavior and repair; do not score the tree itself as a
completed revision. Charge extraction, viewer handoff, inspection and manual
reconciliation when they are used. The four single times with differing
project sizes and no hardware/repetition protocol do not supply a cost model
for this comparison. Further viewer or algorithm reconstruction is conditional
on selecting that operation, rather than a prerequisite for the prepared Nu
button-family question.
